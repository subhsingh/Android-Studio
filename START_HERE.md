## 🎯 What This App Does (In Simple Terms)

**Scenario: A woman feels unsafe**

1. She opens Suraksha Kavach app
2. **Holds the red SOS button for 2 seconds**
3. Confirms emergency activation
4. **App automatically:**
   - Gets her current GPS location
   - Sends SMS to ALL her emergency contacts with her location
   - Calls emergency services (112)
   - Sounds a loud alarm for 30 seconds
   - Vibrates the phone continuously
5. Her emergency contacts receive:
   - SMS: "🚨 EMERGENCY! I need help. My current location: [Google Maps link]"

- **No cloud storage** or tracking
- **No login required**
- **No ads** or analytics
- Works **offline** (SMS/calls don't need internet)

### ⚠️ Testing Safety
**Before real-world use:**
1. Test with willing contacts who know it's a test
2. Use test phone numbers during development
3. Disable auto-call during testing
4. Turn off alarm in public places during testing

### ⚠️ Real Emergency Use
- This is a **supplementary tool**, not a replacement for emergency services
- Always call official emergency services (112/911) when possible
- Keep phone charged and accessible
- Test the app once so you know how it works
